# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). This project uses a LSTM model to predict if a tweet is disaster-relevant.
