# Machine Learning/ Data Science Portfolio by Ka Hei Chow

This repository is to serve as a general overview of the standalone data science projects I've worked on apart from my work. Each project's README.md acts as a full description of the project. All of these projects are in Python and R.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- [Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/EfficientNet-rice-disease-detection)
  - Classification challenge on rice paddy images where different dieseases were the class of interest. I spent most of my time on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a deep learning model built on EfficientNet for my submission, where classification accuracy on validation and testing data ranges from 97% to 98%.

- [Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/CNN-whale-fin-identification)
  - Identify whales and dolphins by unique characteristics


## Unsupervised Machine Learning

- [Clustering](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/VIIRS_Thermal_Fire_Detection)
  - Active Fire clustering.
 

## Visualizations

- [Geospatial](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/Burkina_Faso_Inland_Water_Bodies_Time_Series)
  - Visualized geospatial data using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and folium.


## Spatial Modelling

- [Home Range Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)

- SDM

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- [Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/disaster-tweets)

- [Digital Chinese History Blog](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/digital-chinese-history-blog)
  - Chinese Text Analysis

## Dashboard

- [Data Dashboard](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/HomeRangeAnalysis)
  - Created a geospatial dashboard using flexdashboard generate visualizations for Gorillas' home range.

## Image Processing

- Snow Cover Product
  - Developed a snow classification scheme on long-term AVHRR satellite data with spatial and temporal filters
  - Integration test using pytest

- [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/Priestley_Glacier_GNSS_Positioning_Assessment)
